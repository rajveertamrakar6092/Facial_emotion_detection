# Facial_emotion_detection
This is my project , which detect facial emotion through live camera feed using ML model and Computer vision
I have made this project using python ans other libraries and made a web application using flask.
It works on a model which i have trained on Kaggle dataset in Jypter notebook upto 67% accuracy 
It can detect facial emotion using live camera feed .
The libraries / modules are mentioned in requirements.txt
To run the project follow to steps:-
Download files (app.py) (trainmodel.ipynb) (static.css) (index.html) (emotiondetector.h5)
Make these file location change in code accordingly.
Save in same folder 
Ensure to run in environment with all libraries and dependencies installed .
Run the code then it will generate a URL for local window click it to open in browser 
Click on Detect button to make it work .
